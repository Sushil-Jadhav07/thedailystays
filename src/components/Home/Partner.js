                At The Daily Stays, we believe that every professional on the move deserves more than just a place to stay; they deserve a space that supports their lifestyle, nurtures their well-being, and helps them stay productive and comfortable, even while away from home. Thatâ€™s why weâ€™ve built a growing network of fully managed, fully furnished corporate stays tailored specifically for modern businesses and their teams. Whether your employees are relocating, traveling for a project, attending training sessions, or simply need short-term housing, our properties are thoughtfully designed to simplify their experience, and yours.
        <br />    <br />
Each stay comes equipped with everything a working professional needs: high-speed WiFi, cozy interiors, daily housekeeping, laundry services, nutritious meals, easy check-ins, and responsive on-ground support. We currently operate across prime business locations in Mumbai and Pune, with expansion underway into other major cities.
<br />    <br />
By registering The Daily Stays as your official corporate housing vendor, your company gains access to standardized, high-quality accommodations; pre-negotiated corporate rates; simplified monthly billing; and GST-compliant invoicing. Our dedicated account managers work directly with your HR, admin, or travel teams to tailor stay plans, manage bookings, and ensure a smooth, consistent experience for every team member, every time. We understand the nuances of corporate travel, and weâ€™re here to make it more reliable, more human, and completely stress-free.
